LibMiriSDR-RSP
============

This is (yet) another flavour of libmirisdr initiated with original libmirisdr-2 from Miroslav Slugen and additions of Leif Asbrink SM5BSZ in libmirisdr-3-bsz. Bear with me for the missing special characters on both authors names.

this is a fork of F4EXB libmirisdr4 for SDRPlay RSP Hardware only (www.sdrplay.com)
